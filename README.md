This project focuses on analyzing employee attrition patterns within an organization using SQL. By leveraging structured queries on a comprehensive HR dataset, the case study investigates key factors contributing to workforce turnover and highlights insights that can guide HR decision-making.

**Objectives**

Calculate the overall attrition rate in the organization.
Identify departments and job roles with the highest employee turnover.
Analyze the effect of business travel and job satisfaction on attrition.
Study demographic patterns including gender, age group, and education field.
Examine average monthly income across job roles.
Understand how remote work proximity influences employee retention.

**Dataset Features**

The dataset (employees table from Srishtidb) includes:
Demographics: Gender, Age Group, Education Field
Job Information: Department, Job Role, Business Travel
Compensation: Monthly Income
Behavioral Data: Job Satisfaction, Attrition
Location: Distance From Home

**Tools & Technologies**

SQL (MySQL) – Core query language for data analysis
Relational Database – MySQL database Srishtidb

**Key Insights**

Some departments and roles exhibit significantly higher attrition.
Employees who travel frequently or have lower job satisfaction are more likely to leave.
Attrition varies across age and gender groups, suggesting demographic influence.
Significant gaps in monthly income may be tied to retention challenges.
A small portion of employees work remotely (DistanceFromHome = 0), with possible implications for retention.
